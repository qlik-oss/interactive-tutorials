Before we can begin this tutorial you need to have an instance of QIX-engine running in the Katacoda environment. Throughout this tutorial you will learn how to communicate with that instance using corectl. 

## Start the engine 
In order to use engine you have to accept the EULA. By clicking on this command, you accept EULA: `ACCEPT_EULA=yes docker-compose up -d`{{execute}}

## Prepared files
There are 5 prepared files in this repository that we will use. You can check them out now or wait until they appear in the tutorial.
