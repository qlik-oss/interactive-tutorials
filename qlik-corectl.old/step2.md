corectl is a command line tool to perform reloads, fetch metadata and evaluate expressions in Qlik Core apps. <br>

## Running corectl on you local machine
If you want to run corectl locally on you machine see the [corectl documentation](https://github.com/qlik-oss/corectl#install) to install corectl.

You will also need a engine running in a docker container. If you are unfamiliar with docker you can read more about [docker containers](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container) after the tutorial. <br>

If you are curious about what docker-compose file we use in this example you can find it here `cat ../docker-compose.yml`{{execute}}

However in this tutorial you don't have to worry about docker or installing corectl. **Everything is preinstalled** in the environment.
