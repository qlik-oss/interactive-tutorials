The setup uses [Node.js]https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm and [Docker](https://www.docker.com), we suggest you read more about them after the tutorial

Before you can use the Qlik engine you need to accept the EULA by defining the ACCEPT_EULA environment variable. 
`ACCEPT_EULA=yes docker-compose up -d`{{execute}}
